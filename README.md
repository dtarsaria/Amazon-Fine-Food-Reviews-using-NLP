This Review dataset consists of more than 500,000 rows of user reviews on amazonâ€™s fine food products 
sold everyday for the time span of 10 years. We will try to predict the reviews based on the comments 
using Topic modelling and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).
We will explore the dataset to get some interesting findings for the model to execute. 
We will use Topic Modelling to gain general understanding about the what the reviews are about, and their ratings bases on the wordcount.
